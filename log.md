# 100 Days Of Code - Log

Create an application for sharing transcript working on browser with using Rust language.

### Day 0: April 4, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Create a Rust file to try a simple key rotation with Indy SDK.

**Thoughts:** I really struggled with understanding Rust syntax because it's quite new language for me.

### Day 1: April 5, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Spend the most of time to setup Rust development env

**Thoughts:** It might be difficult to make use this one hour only for purely coding until settling in this activity.

### Day 2: April 8, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Code Scaffolding code that likely to appear in anything that uses indy. But it doesn't work on my environment. I have some error.

**Thoughts:** Once an error happen, the state of the environment seems to be left unexpected, I think. I need to understand how to clean up my env

### Day 3: April 9, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Done debug for my first Rust exercise. Now it works successfull without any errors. Good!

**Thoughts:** At the same time with this activity, I might have better take some classes for Rust in Udemy.

### Day 4: April 10, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Stuck in the key rotation. I likely use obsoleted APIs in my code.

**Thoughts:** I need to change the reference to be read for writing my first project code.
